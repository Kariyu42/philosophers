# philosophers
The Philosophers project involves simulating the dining behaviour of philosophers around a table. Each philosopher needs two forks to eat, and they can only eat, sleep, or think at any given time. The challenge is to synchronise their actions, prevent starvation, and avoid conflicts when multiple philosophers try to grab the same forks.
